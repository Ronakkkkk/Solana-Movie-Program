# Solana-Movie-Program
This is a web3 solana movie program written on rust, which takes users input about a movie review, validates it with thorough checks and stores it in PDAs; accounts in solana  network. Also lets one update the review. But the best part is, it gives you tokens in your wallet everytime you add or comment on someones review.
